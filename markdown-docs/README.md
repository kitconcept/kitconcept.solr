# Markdown Documentation

Only markdown documentation in this folder. No Sphinx documentation, no build, no Makefile, nothing else just plain markdown files, that can easily be read by both humans and machines.

## Why?

We want to keep the documentation simple and easy to read. We want to avoid the complexity of Sphinx documentation, the Makefile, and the build process.

## How to add documentation?

Add a new markdown file to the `markdown-docs` folder.

## How to read the documentation?

Read the documentation in the `markdown-docs` folder.
